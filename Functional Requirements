Final Project Functional Requirements

•	The final project for our group will consist of client server chat room. 
•	The project will have a multi-threaded sever design to connect with several clients at once
•	Each client will have its own GUI which will display messages from all users, the custom message the user wishes to send, and send and quit push buttons. 
•	The messages will be written into a socket which will be processed by the server. 
•	The sever will thus handle all incoming messages and broadcast them to all connected clients
•	The client and server will be modeled after assignment 7
•	Each user will observe the following GUI after connecting to the server:

  Test 3: Quitting and closing the client properly
  Test 4: Client signals server when quitting so quit messages captured by the server
  
- Server
